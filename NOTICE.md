Initial change: 
Adding Cerebras Planning and Optimization (CePO). CePO is a method to empower Llama with reasoning, via test-time compute. [Learn more in the blog](https://cerebras.ai/blog/cepo)

At a high-level, in CePO, we make m attempts to generate n step-by-step plans, refine the plans, check inconsistencies between them, use the above feedback to generate the final plan and produce the answer. This process is them repeated N times in a classical best of n manner.

Ongoing Apache-licensed contributions:
* Added the implementation of CePO
* Integrated CePO with optillm
