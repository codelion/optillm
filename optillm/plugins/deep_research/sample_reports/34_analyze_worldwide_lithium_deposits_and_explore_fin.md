## 1. Introduction and Background

Lithium is an indispensable component in the rechargeable batteries powering the global transition towards electric mobility and renewable energy storage. The demand for lithium has surged dramatically, with projections indicating a substantial increase from approximately half a million metric tons in 2021 to an estimated 3 million to 4 million metric tons by 2030 [12]. This growth is primarily fueled by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles and renewable energy storage systems [12]. This report aims to provide a foundational understanding of the world's lithium resources and the financial landscape surrounding their extraction and processing. It examines current reserve estimates, explores the financial mechanisms financing this burgeoning industry, and assesses the potential for sustainable investment.

## 2. Global Lithium Deposit Distribution

Global lithium reserves are estimated at 105 million tonnes [1]. Over half of these resources are concentrated in the salt flats of Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina, collectively known as the "Lithium Triangle" [1]. Bolivia holds the largest share with 23 million tonnes (21.89% of global reserves), primarily located in the Salar de Uyuni [1]. Argentina ranks second with 22 million tonnes (20.94%), with significant reserves also found in salt flats like the Salar del Hombre Muerto [1]. Chile holds 11 million tonnes (10.47%) of reserves [1]. Australia possesses substantial reserves with 8.7 million tonnes (8.28% of global reserves) and was the leading global lithium producer in 2023, contributing 86,000 tonnes [1, 2]. China holds 6.8 million tonnes (6.47% of global reserves) and is a dominant force in lithium processing and battery manufacturing [1]. Canada has 3 million tonnes (2.86%) of total reserves [1]. The United States holds 14 million tonnes (13.32%) of reserves, with significant potential identified in the Smackover formation in Southern Arkansas [1]. Chile, however, is reported to hold the largest "economically extractable" lithium reserves at 9.3 million metric tons, with its Salar de Atacama region housing approximately 33 percent of the world's lithium reserve base [2].

## 3. Extraction and Processing Technologies

Lithium extraction primarily occurs through two main methods: hard-rock mining (e.g., spodumene) and brine evaporation [2]. Hard-rock mining typically involves open-pit operations, which are energy-intensive and can generate substantial waste rock and tailings [2]. Brine extraction involves pumping underground brine pools to the surface for processing, generally requiring less water and producing less waste [2]. Lithium chemicals derived from hard rock sources can be over three times as carbon-intensive as those from brine sources [1]. Processing hard rock is also a more energy-intensive process than brine extraction [2]. In 2019, average total cash costs at hard-rock lithium mines were projected to be less than half of those at brine operations [S&P Global Market Intelligence]. Furthermore, lithium brine exploration is generally considered less expensive than comparable hard rock projects due to more straightforward logistics and permitting [Visual Capitalist].

## 4. Financial Trends in Extraction & Processing

Lithium extraction and processing are capital-intensive endeavors, necessitating significant upfront investment for exploration, mine development, and chemical processing facilities [1]. Debt financing, alongside equity, serves as a crucial source of capital for major mining companies in the lithium sector [Wojewszak, 2024]. Companies actively seek advantageous debt financing structures to balance cost efficiency with long-term project viability [Investingnews.com].

Examples of financing strategies illustrate this balance. Lithium Americas Corp. (LAC) has secured a Department of Energy (DOE) loan for construction and established a joint venture with General Motors (GM). Ganfeng Lithium employs a diverse financing strategy that includes corporate bonds and equity financing. Both companies demonstrate a commitment to balancing debt and equity to support their growth initiatives [DCFModeling.com (LAC), DCFModeling.com (Ganfeng)].

## 5. Market Dynamics and Pricing

The demand for lithium is unequivocally on an upward trajectory, primarily driven by the automotive sector's transition to electric vehicles (EVs) [12]. By 2030, batteries are projected to account for 94% of global lithium use [12]. Global EV sales are expected to grow from 10 million units in 2022 to nearly 50 million by 2030 [2, 12]. Global lithium consumption in 2023 was estimated at 180,000 tons, representing a 27% increase from 2022 [USGS.gov].

Lithium prices have historically exhibited significant volatility. For instance, prices surged to US$26,200 per tonne in late 2021, reaching US$67,000 per tonne by late 2022, before experiencing a substantial decline in 2023 due to oversupply concerns and softer EV sales [1]. As of February 21, 2025, battery-grade lithium carbonate prices were approximately $9,271.17 USD/mt, reflecting a considerable drop from previous peaks [Metal.com]. This volatility is attributed to soaring demand, rapid influxes of new projects, supply surpluses, and shifts in government subsidies and EV sales trends [1, 12]. Recent data indicates that lithium carbonate prices rose to CNY 68,000 per tonne in July, extending a rebound from a four-year low. However, oversupply has also led to multi-year lows for lithium prices in 2025, despite robust demand [TradingEconomics.com, Investingnews.com].

## 6. Technological Advancements

Advancements in extraction technologies, notably **Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE)**, hold considerable promise for enhancing the efficiency and reducing the environmental footprint of brine processing [3, 4, 10, 11, 12]. DLE technologies circumvent the traditional, time-consuming evaporation ponds, offering faster production cycles (hours to days compared to months or years), significantly reduced water consumption, and a smaller environmental impact [4, 10]. A variety of DLE approaches are being developed, including adsorption, ion exchange, solvent extraction, and electrochemical methods [4]. Some DLE technologies can achieve high lithium recovery rates (exceeding 90%) and high selectivity, thereby minimizing the need for extensive purification [4, 12]. Redox-couple electrodialysis (RCE), for example, has demonstrated nearly 100% lithium selectivity and can operate continuously, potentially contributing to market stabilization [12]. Electrochemical methods, such as those utilizing lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) electrodes, can directly produce battery-grade lithium hydroxide from geothermal brines with high purity and potentially lower costs [13]. DLE from brine exhibits a significantly lower CO₂ footprint (neutral) and water consumption compared to hard rock mining [12]. However, the commercial viability and scalability of specific DLE technologies warrant further investigation [12]. DLE is also being explored for application in the recycling streams of EV lithium-ion batteries [Saleem, 2025]. Over 30 companies are actively developing DLE technology, with current output concentrated in Argentina and China, and projections indicate a significant increase by 2028 [Wood Mackenzie].

## 7. Sustainable Investment Opportunities and ESG Considerations

The lithium industry presents emerging opportunities for sustainable investment, with a growing focus on environmentally and socially responsible practices throughout the supply chain. Key ESG concerns in lithium extraction include water usage, particularly in arid brine-producing regions, and potential impacts on groundwater levels and local communities [ISS ESG]. Environmental controversies often revolve around water pollution, biodiversity loss, and air emissions from processing, as well as potential impacts on indigenous rights [ISS ESG]. While Australia and Canada generally exhibit stronger ESG country scores within the lithium supply chain, significant industry-wide issues persist [ISS ESG].

Encouragingly, over 40% of 2024 lithium feedstock is anticipated to originate from companies with industry-leading ESG scores, signaling a growing investor emphasis on sustainability [Benchmark Minerals]. This trend highlights the increasing importance of evaluating companies based on their environmental stewardship, social impact, and governance practices when considering investment in the lithium sector.

## 8. Conclusion

The global lithium landscape is characterized by robust demand growth, driven by the indispensable role of lithium-ion batteries in the transition to electric mobility and renewable energy. Significant reserves are concentrated in South America and Australia, with diverse extraction and processing methods employed, each carrying distinct environmental and cost implications. While hard-rock mining remains prevalent, advancements in Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) offer promising avenues for more efficient and sustainable operations. The financial landscape is marked by capital-intensive projects requiring substantial debt and equity financing, with companies navigating price volatility influenced by supply-demand dynamics and technological shifts. Sustainable investment opportunities are emerging as investors increasingly scrutinize ESG performance, with a growing proportion of feedstock expected from companies demonstrating strong environmental and social responsibility. Continued research into granular reserve data, operational costs, financing structures, and the long-term impact of technological advancements will be crucial for informing strategic investment decisions within this dynamic and critical sector.
