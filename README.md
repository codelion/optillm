**OptiLLM** is an OpenAI API-compatible optimizing inference proxy that implements 20+ state-of-the-art techniques to dramatically improve LLM accuracy and performance on reasoning tasks - without requiring any model training or fine-tuning.

It is possible to beat the frontier models using these techniques across diverse tasks by doing additional compute at inference time. A good example of how to combine such techniques together is the [CePO approach](optillm/cepo) from Cerebras.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎯 Instant Improvements**: 2-10x better accuracy on math, coding, and logical reasoning
- **🔌 Drop-in Replacement**: Works with any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint  
- **🧠 20+ Optimization Techniques**: From simple best-of-N to advanced MCTS and planning
- **📦 Zero Training Required**: Just proxy your existing API calls through OptiLLM
- **⚡ Production Ready**: Used in production by companies and researchers worldwide
- **🌍 Multi-Provider**: Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cerebras, and 100+ models via LiteLLM

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get powerful reasoning improvements in 3 simple steps:

```bash
# 1. Install OptiLLM
pip install optillm

# 2. Start the server
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
optillm

# 3. Use with any OpenAI client - just change the model name!
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1")

# Add 'moa-' prefix for Mixture of Agents optimization
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="moa-gpt-4o-mini",  # This gives you GPT-4o performance from GPT-4o-mini!
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Solve: If 2x + 3 = 7, what is x?"}]
)
```

**Before OptiLLM**: "x = 1" ❌  
**After OptiLLM**: "Let me work through this step by step: 2x + 3 = 7, so 2x = 4, therefore x = 2" ✅

## 📊 Proven Results

OptiLLM delivers measurable improvements across diverse benchmarks:

| Technique | Base Model | Improvement | Benchmark |

### Install from source

Clone the repository with `git` and use `pip install` to setup the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codelion/optillm.git
cd optillm
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔒 SSL Configuration

OptILLM supports SSL certificate verification configuration for working with self-signed certificates or corporate proxies.

**Disable SSL verification (development only):**
```bash
# Command line
optillm --no-ssl-verify

# Environment variable
export OPTILLM_SSL_VERIFY=false
optillm
```

**Use custom CA certificate:**
```bash
# Command line
optillm --ssl-cert-path /path/to/ca-bundle.crt

# Environment variable
export OPTILLM_SSL_CERT_PATH=/path/to/ca-bundle.crt
optillm
```

⚠️ **Security Note**: Disabling SSL verification is insecure and should only be used in development. For production environments with custom CAs, use `--ssl-cert-path` instead. See [SSL_CONFIGURATION.md](SSL_CONFIGURATION.md) for details.

| LiteLLM | depends on the model | See [docs for details](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) |

You can then run the optillm proxy as follows.

```bash
python optillm.py
2024-09-06 07:57:14,191 - INFO - Starting server with approach: auto
2024-09-06 07:57:14,191 - INFO - Server configuration: {'approach': 'auto', 'mcts_simulations': 2, 'mcts_exploration': 0.2, 'mcts_depth': 1, 'best_of_n': 3, 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'rstar_max_depth': 3, 'rstar_num_rollouts': 5, 'rstar_c': 1.4, 'base_url': ''}

```
## Usage

Once the proxy is running, you can use it as a drop in replacement for an OpenAI client by setting the `base_url` as `http://localhost:8000/v1`.

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI

OPENAI_KEY = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
OPENAI_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000/v1"
client = OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_KEY, base_url=OPENAI_BASE_URL)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="moa-gpt-4o",
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Write a Python program to build an RL model to recite text from any position that the user provides, using only numpy."
    }
  ],
  temperature=0.2
)

print(response)
```
The code above applies to both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI, just remember to populate the `OPENAI_API_KEY` env variable with the proper key.
There are multiple ways to control the optimization techniques, they are applied in the follow order of preference:

- You can control the technique you use for optimization by prepending the slug to the model name `{slug}-model-name`. E.g. in the above code we are using `moa` or mixture of agents as the optimization approach. In the proxy logs you will see the following showing the `moa` is been used with the base model as `gpt-4o-mini`.

```bash
2024-09-06 08:35:32,597 - INFO - Using approach moa, with gpt-4o-mini
2024-09-06 08:35:35,358 - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2024-09-06 08:35:39,553 - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2024-09-06 08:35:44,795 - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2024-09-06 08:35:44,797 - INFO - 127.0.0.1 - - [06/Sep/2024 08:35:44] "POST /v1/chat/completions HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

- Or, you can pass the slug in the `optillm_approach` field in the `extra_body`.

```bash
response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4o-mini",
  messages=[{ "role": "user","content": "" }],
  temperature=0.2,
  extra_body={"optillm_approach": "bon|moa|mcts"}
)
```
- Or, you can just mention the approach in either your `system` or `user` prompt, within `<optillm_approach> </optillm_approach>` tags.

```bash
response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4o-mini",
  messages=[{ "role": "user","content": "<optillm_approach>re2</optillm_approach> How many r's are there in strawberry?" }],
  temperature=0.2
)
```

> [!TIP]
> You can also combine different techniques either by using symbols `&` and `|`. When you use `&` the techniques are processed in the order from left to right in a pipeline
> with response from previous stage used as request to the next. While, with `|` we run all the requests in parallel and generate multiple responses that are returned as a list.

Please note that the convention described above works only when the optillm server has been started with inference approach set to `auto`. Otherwise, the `model` attribute in the client request must be set with the model name only.

We now support all LLM providers (by wrapping around the [LiteLLM sdk](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/#litellm-python-sdk)). E.g. you can use the Gemini Flash model with `moa` by setting passing the api key in the environment variable `os.environ['GEMINI_API_KEY']` and then calling the model `moa-gemini/gemini-1.5-flash-002`. In the output you will then see that LiteLLM is being used to call the base model.

```bash
9:43:21 - LiteLLM:INFO: utils.py:2952 -
LiteLLM completion() model= gemini-1.5-flash-002; provider = gemini
2024-09-29 19:43:21,011 - INFO -
LiteLLM completion() model= gemini-1.5-flash-002; provider = gemini
2024-09-29 19:43:21,481 - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash-002:generateContent?key=[redacted] "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
19:43:21 - LiteLLM:INFO: utils.py:988 - Wrapper: Completed Call, calling success_handler
2024-09-29 19:43:21,483 - INFO - Wrapper: Completed Call, calling success_handler
19:43:21 - LiteLLM:INFO: utils.py:2952 -
LiteLLM completion() model= gemini-1.5-flash-002; provider = gemini
```

> [!TIP]
> optillm is a transparent proxy and will work with any LLM API or provider that has an OpenAI API compatible chat completions endpoint, and in turn, optillm also exposes
the same OpenAI API compatible chat completions endpoint. This should allow you to integrate it into any existing tools or frameworks easily. If the LLM you want to use
doesn't have an OpenAI API compatible endpoint (like Google or Anthropic) you can use [LiteLLM proxy server](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/proxy/quick_start) that supports most LLMs.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the request and responses go through optillm.

![Sequance diagram showing optillm in use](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codelion/optillm/main/optillm-sequence-diagram.png)

In the diagram:
- `A` is an existing tool (like [oobabooga](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/)), framework (like [patchwork](https://github.com/patched-codes/patchwork))
or your own code where you want to use the results from optillm. You can use it directly using any OpenAI client sdk.
- `B` is the optillm service (running directly or in a docker container) that will send requests to the `base_url`.
- `C` is any service providing an OpenAI API compatible chat completions endpoint.

### Local inference server

We support loading any HuggingFace model or LoRA directly in optillm. To use the built-in inference server set the `OPTILLM_API_KEY` to any value (e.g. `export OPTILLM_API_KEY="optillm"`)
and then use the same in your OpenAI client. You can pass any HuggingFace model in model field. If it is a private model make sure you set the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable
with your HuggingFace key. We also support adding any number of LoRAs on top of the model by using the `+` separator.

E.g. The following code loads the base model `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct` and then adds two LoRAs on top - `patched-codes/Llama-3.2-1B-FixVulns` and `patched-codes/Llama-3.2-1B-FastApply`.
You can specify which LoRA to use using the `active_adapter` param in `extra_body` field of OpenAI SDK client. By default we will load the last specified adapter.

```python
OPENAI_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000/v1"
OPENAI_KEY = "optillm"
response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct+patched-codes/Llama-3.2-1B-FastApply+patched-codes/Llama-3.2-1B-FixVulns",
  messages=messages,
  temperature=0.2,
  logprobs = True,
  top_logprobs = 3,
  extra_body={"active_adapter": "patched-codes/Llama-3.2-1B-FastApply"},
)
```

You can also use the alternate decoding techniques like `cot_decoding` and `entropy_decoding` directly with the local inference server.

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct",
  messages=messages,
  temperature=0.2,
  extra_body={
        "decoding": "cot_decoding",  # or "entropy_decoding"
        # CoT specific params
        "k": 10,
        "aggregate_paths": True,
        # OR Entropy specific params
        "top_k": 27,
        "min_p": 0.03,
    }
)
```

### Starting the optillm proxy with an external server (e.g. llama.cpp or ollama)

- Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` env variable to a placeholder value
  - e.g. `export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-no-key"`
- Run `./llama-server -c 4096 -m path_to_model` to start the server with the specified model and a context length of 4096 tokens
- Run `python3 optillm.py --base_url base_url` to start the proxy
  - e.g. for llama.cpp, run `python3 optillm.py --base_url http://localhost:8080/v1`

> The Anthropic API, llama.cpp-server, and ollama currently do not support sampling multiple responses from a model, which limits the available approaches to the following:
> `cot_reflection`, `leap`, `plansearch`, `rstar`, `rto`, `self_consistency`, `re2`, and `z3`. For models on HuggingFace, you can use the built-in local inference server as it supports multiple responses.

### MCP Plugin

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) plugin enables OptiLLM to connect with MCP servers, bringing external tools, resources, and prompts into the context of language models. This allows for powerful integrations with filesystem access, database queries, API connections, and more.

OptiLLM supports both **local** and **remote** MCP servers through multiple transport methods:
- **stdio**: Local servers (traditional)
- **SSE**: Remote servers via Server-Sent Events
- **WebSocket**: Remote servers via WebSocket connections

#### What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) is an open protocol standard that allows LLMs to securely access tools and data sources through a standardized interface. MCP servers can provide:

- **Tools**: Callable functions that perform actions (like writing files, querying databases, etc.)
- **Resources**: Data sources for providing context (like file contents)
- **Prompts**: Reusable prompt templates for specific use cases

#### Configuration

##### Setting up MCP Config

> **Note on Backwards Compatibility**: Existing MCP configurations will continue to work unchanged. The `transport` field defaults to "stdio" when not specified, maintaining full backwards compatibility with existing setups.

1. Create a configuration file at `~/.optillm/mcp_config.json` with the following structure:

**Local Server (stdio) - Traditional Method:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "transport": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "/path/to/allowed/directory1",
        "/path/to/allowed/directory2"
      ],
      "env": {},
      "description": "Local filesystem access"
    }
  },
  "log_level": "INFO"
}
```

**Legacy Format (still works):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/directory"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

**Remote Server (SSE) - New Feature:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "transport": "sse",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${GITHUB_TOKEN}",
        "Accept": "text/event-stream"
      },
      "timeout": 30.0,
      "sse_read_timeout": 300.0,
      "description": "GitHub MCP server for repository access"
    }
  },
  "log_level": "INFO"
}
```

**Remote Server (WebSocket) - New Feature:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "remote-ws": {
      "transport": "websocket",
      "url": "wss://api.example.com/mcp",
      "description": "Remote WebSocket MCP server"
    }
  },
  "log_level": "INFO"
}
```

**Mixed Configuration (Local + Remote):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "transport": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/home/user/docs"],
      "description": "Local filesystem access"
    },
    "github": {
      "transport": "sse",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
      },
      "description": "GitHub MCP server"
    },
    "remote-api": {
      "transport": "websocket",
      "url": "wss://api.company.com/mcp",
      "description": "Company internal MCP server"
    }
  },
  "log_level": "INFO"
}
```

##### Configuration Parameters

**Common Parameters:**
- **Server name**: A unique identifier for the server (e.g., "filesystem", "github")
- **transport**: Transport method - "stdio" (default), "sse", or "websocket"
- **description** (optional): Description of the server's functionality
- **timeout** (optional): Connection timeout in seconds (default: 5.0)

**stdio Transport (Local Servers):**
- **command**: The executable to run the server
- **args**: Command-line arguments for the server
- **env**: Environment variables for the server process

**sse Transport (Server-Sent Events):**
- **url**: The SSE endpoint URL
- **headers** (optional): HTTP headers for authentication
- **sse_read_timeout** (optional): SSE read timeout in seconds (default: 300.0)

**websocket Transport (WebSocket):**
- **url**: The WebSocket endpoint URL

**Environment Variable Expansion:**
Headers and other string values support environment variable expansion using `${VARIABLE_NAME}` syntax. This is especially useful for API keys:
```json
{
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer ${GITHUB_TOKEN}",
    "X-API-Key": "${MY_API_KEY}"
  }
}
```

#### Available MCP Servers

OptiLLM supports both local and remote MCP servers:

##### Local MCP Servers (stdio transport)

You can use any of the [official MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/examples) or third-party servers that run as local processes:

- **Filesystem**: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` - File operations
- **Git**: `mcp-server-git` - Git repository operations
- **SQLite**: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-sqlite` - SQLite database access
- **Brave Search**: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search` - Web search capabilities

##### Remote MCP Servers (SSE/WebSocket transport)

Remote servers provide centralized access without requiring local installation:

- **GitHub MCP Server**: `https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp` - Repository management, issue tracking, and code analysis
- **Third-party servers**: Any MCP server that supports SSE or WebSocket protocols

##### Example: Comprehensive Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "transport": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/home/user/documents"],
      "description": "Local file system access"
    },
    "search": {
      "transport": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search"],
      "env": {
        "BRAVE_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      },
      "description": "Web search capabilities"
    },
    "github": {
      "transport": "sse",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${GITHUB_TOKEN}",
        "Accept": "text/event-stream"
      },
      "description": "GitHub repository and issue management"
    }
  },
  "log_level": "INFO"
}
```

#### Using the MCP Plugin

Once configured, the MCP plugin will automatically:

1. Connect to all configured MCP servers
2. Discover available tools, resources, and prompts
3. Make these capabilities available to the language model
4. Handle tool calls and resource requests

The plugin enhances the system prompt with MCP capabilities so the model knows which tools are available. When the model decides to use a tool, the plugin:

1. Executes the tool with the provided arguments
2. Returns the results to the model
3. Allows the model to incorporate the results into its response

#### Example Queries

Here are some examples of queries that will engage MCP tools:

**Local Server Examples:**
- "List all the Python files in my documents directory" (Filesystem)
- "What are the recent commits in my Git repository?" (Git)
- "Search for the latest information about renewable energy" (Search)
- "Query my database for all users who registered this month" (Database)

**Remote Server Examples:**
- "Show me the open issues in my GitHub repository" (GitHub MCP)
- "Create a new branch for the feature I'm working on" (GitHub MCP)
- "What are the most recent pull requests that need review?" (GitHub MCP)
- "Get the file contents from my remote repository" (GitHub MCP)

#### Troubleshooting

##### Logs

The MCP plugin logs detailed information to:
```
~/.optillm/logs/mcp_plugin.log
```

Check this log file for connection issues, tool execution errors, and other diagnostic information.

##### Common Issues

**Local Server Issues (stdio transport):**

1. **Command not found**: Make sure the server executable is available in your PATH, or use an absolute path in the configuration.

2. **Access denied**: For filesystem operations, ensure the paths specified in the configuration are accessible to the process.

**Remote Server Issues (SSE/WebSocket transport):**

3. **Connection timeout**: Remote servers may take longer to connect. Increase the `timeout` value in your configuration.

4. **Authentication failed**: Verify your API keys and tokens are correct. For GitHub MCP server, ensure your `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable is set with appropriate permissions.

5. **Network errors**: Check your internet connection and verify the server URL is accessible.

6. **Environment variable not found**: If using `${VARIABLE_NAME}` syntax, ensure the environment variables are set before starting OptILLM.

**General Issues:**

7. **Method not found**: Some servers don't implement all MCP capabilities (tools, resources, prompts). Verify which capabilities the server supports.

8. **Transport not supported**: Ensure you're using a supported transport: "stdio", "sse", or "websocket".

**Example: Testing GitHub MCP Connection**

To test if your GitHub MCP server configuration is working:

1. Set your GitHub token: `export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-github-token"`
2. Start OptILLM and check the logs at `~/.optillm/logs/mcp_plugin.log`
3. Look for connection success messages and discovered capabilities

## Running with Docker

optillm can optionally be built and run using Docker and the provided [Dockerfile](https://github.com/codelion/optillm/blob/main/Dockerfile).

### Using Docker Compose

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

2. Either update the environment variables in the docker-compose.yaml file or create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add any environment variables you want to set. For example, to set the OpenAI API key, add the following line to the `.env` file:

   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

3. Run the following command to start optillm:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   This will build the Docker image if it doesn't exist and start the optillm service.

4. optillm will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

When using Docker, you can set these parameters as environment variables. For example, to set the approach and model, you would use:

```bash
OPTILLM_APPROACH=mcts
OPTILLM_MODEL=gpt-4
```

To secure the optillm proxy with an API key, set the `OPTILLM_API_KEY` environment variable:

```bash
OPTILLM_API_KEY=your_secret_api_key
```

When the API key is set, clients must include it in their requests using the `Authorization` header:

```plain
Authorization: Bearer your_secret_api_key
```

### optillm with Patchwork (July 2024)

Since optillm is a drop-in replacement for OpenAI API you can easily integrate it with existing tools and frameworks using the OpenAI client. We used optillm with [patchwork](https://github.com/patched-codes/patchwork) which is an open-source framework that automates development gruntwork like PR reviews, bug fixing, security patching using workflows
called patchflows. We saw huge performance gains across all the supported patchflows as shown below when using the mixture of agents approach (moa).

## Testing

OptiLLM includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure reliability and compatibility.

### Running Tests

The main test suite can be run from the project root:
```bash
# Test all approaches with default test cases
python tests/test.py

# Test specific approaches
python tests/test.py --approaches moa bon mcts

# Run a single test
python tests/test.py --single-test "Simple Math Problem"
```

### Unit and Integration Tests

Additional tests are available in the `tests/` directory:
```bash
# Run all tests (requires pytest)
./tests/run_tests.sh

# Run specific test modules
pytest tests/test_plugins.py -v
pytest tests/test_api_compatibility.py -v
```

### CI/CD

All tests are automatically run on pull requests via GitHub Actions. The workflow tests:
- Multiple Python versions (3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
- Unit tests for plugins and core functionality
- API compatibility tests
- Integration tests with various approaches

See `tests/README.md` for more details on the test structure and how to write new tests.
